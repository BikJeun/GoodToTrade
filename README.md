# TechStack
Applications will be deployed using Glassfish and will share a common backend, which
will be developed using Java EE. This common backend will be adopting both a
component-based architecture and a service-oriented architecture. As for data storage,
MySQL will be used alongside the Java Persistence API as the database and the
object/relational mapping tool for reading and writing to and from the database.

# To Deploy:
1. Open in Netbeans IDE
2. Change the private properties of the file to your local computer name
3. Go into DataInitSessionBean and change the directory of the test data file
